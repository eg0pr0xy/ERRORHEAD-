# <img src="assets/logo_errorhead.png" alt="ERRORHEAD Logo" width="50"/> ERRORHEAD - Video Glitch Tool

ERRORHEAD is a Python-based desktop application for creating unique glitch art from your videos. It combines audio-reactive elements with shader-based visual effects to offer a range of creative possibilities.

## Features

*   **Single Glitch Mode:**
    *   Load video files (MP4, MOV, AVI).
    *   Optionally load an external audio file (WAV, MP3) to drive effects or replace original audio.
    *   Adjustable video glitch intensity.
    *   Adjustable audio glitch intensity (currently bitcrushing).
    *   Audio-reactive video effects using GLSL shaders (e.g., `reactive_wave.glsl`).
    *   Export glitched videos in MP4 format.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Tkinter and `ttkbootstrap` for a modern look and feel.

**Planned Features:**
*   Live Preview Mode.
*   Batch Processing Mode.
*   More diverse audio glitch effects.
*   A wider selection of GLSL shaders and easier shader management through the GUI.
*   More granular control over glitch parameters.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.7+
*   FFmpeg (must be installed and accessible in your system's PATH for `moviepy` to work correctly for video export).
*   Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
    *   `numpy`
    *   `opencv-python`
    *   `pydub`
    *   `scipy`
    *   `Pillow`
    *   `moviepy`
    *   `ttkbootstrap`
    *   `moderngl` (implicitly required by `shader_manager`)
